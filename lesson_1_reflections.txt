How did viewing a diff between two version of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

By visually identifying the differences between two files, it saved me time in seeing where a bug might have been introduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Having the ability to easily see different versions of a file may help debugging or investigating different ideas with the flexibility of reverting back to a root version.
